# Route Audit Report

**Date:** 2025-03-15  
**Scope:** Frontend routes (App.tsx), backend API routes (server/index.ts), and navigation/API usage across the codebase.

---

## Dead route criteria (checked)

A route/endpoint is considered **dead** when it:

- ❌ **Is not linked in navigation** — no `navigate()`, `<Link to>`, or `href` points to it.
- ❌ **Is not called by frontend/API** — no `fetch()`, `apiUrl()`, or server-side call.
- ❌ **Is not used in redirects** — not the target of `<Navigate to>` or `redirect()`.
- ❌ **Is left from old features** — no current feature or external integration uses it.

**Practice:** Before deleting, mark as deprecated and check 404 logs; remove only after confirming no external callers.

## 2. Borderline / deprecation candidates (mark first, delete later)

These routes are **kept** but have no or few in-app links. If you want to trim later, mark deprecated and check 404 logs before removing.

| Path | Notes | Recommendation |
|------|--------|----------------|
| `/live/watch/:streamId` | Alternate URL for creator live view; no `navigate()` or `<Link>` in codebase. May be used by bookmarks or external links. | Mark deprecated in code comment; monitor 404 or analytics; remove in a future release if unused. |
| `/saved` | Standalone Saved Videos page; Profile has an inline “Saved” tab but no “View all” link to `/saved`. | Consider adding “See all” from Profile saved tab to `/saved`, or mark deprecated and monitor before removing. |

No other routes qualified as borderline; everything else is linked or used in redirects/API.

---

## 3. Removed (dead)

| Item | Reason |
|------|--------|
| **“Manage Videos” link** on Admin Dashboard (`/admin/videos`) | No route exists for `/admin/videos` in App.tsx. The link led to a 404 (then catch-all to /feed). Removed the button and kept three Quick Actions: Manage Users, Review Reports, Economy Controls. |

---

## 4. Backend API routes (server/index.ts)

All registered Express routes were cross-checked with frontend and server usage:

- **Auth:** `/api/auth/*`, `/api/profile` — used (useAuthStore, login, register, etc.).
- **Live:** `/api/live/streams`, `/api/live/start`, `/api/live/end`, `/api/live/token`, `/api/live/moderation/check` — used (LiveStream, SpectatorPage, LiveDiscover, etc.).
- **Gifts:** `/api/gifts/send` — used (LiveStream, SpectatorPage).
- **Payments:** `/api/create-checkout-session`, `/api/create-promote-checkout`, `/api/create-payment-intent`, `/api/create-subscription`, `/api/verify-purchase`, `/api/promote-iap-complete` — used (LiveStream, SpectatorPage, PromotePanel, iap, etc.).
- **Analytics:** `/api/analytics`, `/api/analytics/track` — used (analytics.ts).
- **Profiles:** `/api/profiles/*` — used (Profile, LiveStream, SpectatorPage, avatarUpload, etc.).
- **Feed:** `/api/feed/foryou`, `/api/feed/track-view`, `/api/feed/track-interaction`, `/api/feed/score/:videoId` — used (interactionTracker, useVideoStore).
- **Videos:** `/api/videos`, `/api/videos/:id`, `/api/videos/user/:userId`, `/api/videos/:id` (DELETE) — used (videoUpload, fypEligibility, etc.).
- **Creator:** `/api/creator/*` — used (creator flows).
- **Admin:** `/api/admin/*` — used (admin flows).
- **Shop:** `/api/shop/*` — used (Shop).
- **Media:** `/api/media/upload-file`, `/api/media/delete` — used (bunnyStorage).
- **Misc:** `/api/block-user`, `/api/report`, `/api/delete-account`, `/api/test-coins`, `/api/send-notification`, etc. — used from UI or server-side flows.

No backend routes were removed. Some frontend modules (e.g. `soundLibrary.ts`, `pushNotificationService.ts`) call `/api/sounds` and `/api/device-tokens`; those endpoints exist on the **Fastify** server (`server/src`), not on the **Express** server (`server/index.ts`). If the app runs only Express in production, those calls may 404 unless proxied or implemented there. That is a separate deployment/architecture note, not a “dead route” removal.

---

## 5. Recommended: 404 logs and lint

- **404 logs:** Log or monitor 404s (frontend and API). Routes that never get hit are candidates for deprecation/removal after a period (e.g. 30 days).
- **Lint / checks:** Add a script or ESLint rule that:
  - Parses route definitions (e.g. from `App.tsx` or a routes config).
  - Greps for path strings in the repo (e.g. `"/admin/videos"`, `navigate('/saved')`).
  - Warns when a defined route has zero references (or only in tests).
- **Deprecation pattern:** For borderline routes, add a comment in `App.tsx` and optionally a deprecation banner in the component, e.g. “This page is deprecated and will be removed on YYYY-MM-DD.”

---

## 6. Verification

- **Build:** `npm run build` completed successfully after removing the dead “Manage Videos” link.
- **Navigation:** All remaining routes have at least one in-app navigation path or redirect, or are intentional entry points (e.g. `/live/start`, `/live/watch/:streamId` for bookmarks/direct links).

---

## 7. Summary

| Action | Count |
|--------|--------|
| Routes scanned (frontend) | 50+ |
| Dead link removed | 1 (Admin “Manage Videos” → `/admin/videos`) |
| Routes removed | 0 (no route definition removed) |
| Backend routes removed | 0 |
| Build/test | ✅ Passed |

All current route definitions are kept. The only change was removing the dead “Manage Videos” admin link that pointed to a non-existent `/admin/videos` route.
